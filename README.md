# MailFinder
A simple website with the goal:
> Making your email validation process more efficient

This is now done by converting a singular contact into a list of all possible email formats.
This list is automatically copied to your clipboard so you can find the valid email.
Click the correct format of the valid email and your full contact list is formatted into this valid email format.
This list comprised of all valid emails is also automatically copied to your clipboard. 

### In the future:
I want to make the email validation process also automatic in Js, so the user *only* has to crl-v his list of all contacts
